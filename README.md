# üìÅ About My Project: File System Management

This project simulates a hierarchical file system using SQL. Each file or folder has a unique ID (`NodeID`), a name (`NodeName`), a parent reference (`ParentID`), and a size in bytes (`SizeBytes`). The main objective is to calculate the total size of each folder, including all nested subfolders and files, using a recursive CTE query.

It mirrors how real-world file systems organize and track storage. By building and querying this structure, we can visualize parent-child relationships and compute aggregate folder sizes efficiently. This project demonstrates a practical use of recursion in SQL and the power of Common Table Expressions for hierarchical data processing.
